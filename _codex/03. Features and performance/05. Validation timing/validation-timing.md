title: Validation timing
excerpt: Configuration to reduce load on server.
---

Normally, a plugin will be loaded at a certain phase during WordPress boot 
process and will typically do its jobs after `init` action hook. It means 
that a plugin will be kept waiting until almost all plugins have finished to 
be loaded.

But it's wasteful to give spams and attackers those resources of your server.

The "**Validation timing**" at "**Validation rule settings**" can help to 
drastically reduce load on server especially against brute-force attacks.

### "mu-plugins" (ip-geo-block-mu.php) ###

 "Validation timing"
)

When you select this mode as "**Validation timing**", this plugin will install 
`ip-geo-block-mu.php` into your `/wp-content/mu-plugins/` which is for 
[must-use plugins][MU-plugins]. It means that this plugin will be loaded and 
execute validation prior to other typical plugins.

Note that in case of multisite, `ip-geo-block-mu.php` will be called on every 
site but doesn't affect a site where IP Geo Block is not activated.

#### Restrictions ####

As you can find the order of execution in [action reference][ActionHook], 
mu-plugins are processed prior to theme setup. Consequently, the following 
two restrictions would be raised.

1. **[Custom filter hooks][FilterHooks] in `functions.php` does not work**  
   It is bacause the `functions.php` in the theme folder would not have been
   parsed when this plugin do its jobs. In this case, you **must** put your own
   code into `drop-in.php` which should be placed in the geolocation database 
   folder. You can find `drop-in-sample.php` as a sample in this plugin's 
   folder, i.e. `/wp-content/plugins/ip-geo-block/wp-content/ip-geo-api/`.
   Please rename it to `drop-in.php` and put it into your 
   [Geolocation API folder][GeoAPIFolder] when you use it.

2. **[Human friendly error page][ErrorPage] is unavailable**  
   It is because the theme setup would not have finished when this plugin do 
   its jobs. It means that when you select `404 Not Found` as **Response code**,
   `404.php` in your theme folder might not work. In this case, you **must** 
   save your human friendly error page as a static file. If you want to show a 
   human friendly page for blocked visitors, you **must** configure as follows:  
   
   - Show your 404 page. (e.g. `http://example.com/wp-content/themes/your-theme/404.php`)
   - Save the page as `404.php` using your browser. It means that the content 
     of the file consists of not PHP codes but static HTML codes.
   - Place it into your theme folder. A child theme is recommended to keep the 
     original file in your parent theme folder.
   - In case of `403 Forbidden`, it's almost the same but just save the page as
     `403.php` and change the message as you like.  
  
  ![Human friendly error page]({{ '/img/2016-09/404NotFound.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}  
   "Human friendly error page"  
  )

#### Performance ####

The more plugins you have, the lower site speed you get.

You may be interested in the benchmark of the two "**Validation timing**".
As with [the previous report][LoadOnServer], the test environment and sample 
plugins are showen blow:

| Category  | Description                                          |
|:----------|:-----------------------------------------------------|
| Hardware  | MacBook Pro / 2.8GHz Core i7 / Memory 16GB           |
| Software  | OS X 10.9.5 / MAMP 3.5.2 (Apache 2.2.29, PHP 5.6.10) |
| WordPress | 4.6-ja / Site Language: English                      |

 "Plugins Dashboard"
)

The following tables show comparisons between the two mode of "**Validation 
timing**" against the each target using [ApacheBench] for 60 seconds. As you 
can see, the number of requests have become to be handled more than twice with 
`"mu-plugins" (ip-geo-block-mu.php)`.
