title: Living with caching plugin
---

Definitely we need not only hardening security but also speeding up the site.
So you may want to use [IP Geo Block][IP-Geo-Block] with a caching plugin.

But there is a big challenge in living with a caching plugin because it would 
respond a requested content without excuting any PHP codes at the very begining
of WordPress core proccess. That's why [Wordfence][Wordfence] equips their own 
caching system called [Falcon Engine][FalconEngine] inside of it.

In case of this plugin, there are some restrictions about caching plugins.

<div class="alert alert-info">
	<a href="https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2016/10/removing-falcon-cache-wordfence-heres-need-know/" title="We are removing Falcon Cache from Wordfence. Here's what you need to know. - Wordfence">Wordfence stopped to provide Falcon Engine</a>
	from Wordfence 6.2.1. Alternatively, you can get a derivative version as 
	<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/vendi-cache/">Vendi Cache</a>.
</div>

### Supported plugins ###

Currently, this plugin supports 
  [WP Super Cache][WPSuperCache],
  [W3 Total Cache][W3TotalCache] and
  [Wordfence][Wordfence]
with the following configurations.

| Plugin Name        | Configuration                                                  |
|:-------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------|
| WP Super Cache     | "**Use PHP to serve cache files**" and "**Late init**"         |
| W3 Total Cache     | "**Disk: Basic**" and "**Late initialization**" for page cache |
| Wordfence Security | "**Basic Caching**" + `"mu-plugins" (ip-geo-block-mu.php)`     |

<div class="alert alert-warning">
	If you configure WP Super Cache or W3 Total Cache without enabling 
	"<strong>Late init</strong>" (WPSC) or "<strong>Late initialization</strong>"
	(W3TC), blocking on front-end would not work properly because these plugins 
	respond the contents at the very bigining of WordPress core process 
	without execution of any other plugins.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-info">
	Concerning W3 Total Cache 0.9.5.1, "<strong>Disk: Enhanced</strong>" 
	(where "<strong>Late initialization</strong>" is not available) seems to 
	work good without any imcompatibility with this plugin.
</div>

### Installing MU-Plugins ###

A [must-use plugin][MU-Plugins] is a plugin that will always be activated by 
default and be loaded prior to other typical plugins when you install it into 
your `wp-content/mu-plugins/` directory.

You can install the PHP file `ip-geo-block/wp-content/mu-plugins/ip-geo-block-mu.php`
into your MU-Plugins directory in order to run at the early phase of WordPress 
core process.

 "Validation Timing"
)

<div class="alert alert-warning">
	This is recommended for <strong>WP Super Cache</strong> and 
	<strong>W3 Total Cache</strong>, and indispensable for 
	<strong>Wordfence (Vendi Cache)</strong> which doesn't support
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_initialization" title="Lazy initialization - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">deferred initialization</a>.
</div>

#### Restrictions ####

Installing `ip-geo-block-mu.php` into MU-Plugins has following restrictions 
mainly because of its execution timing which is before `after_setup_theme` 
action hook:

- You should write your own code for [custom filter hooks][FilterHooks] not 
  in your theme's `functions.php` but `drop-in.php` in your [geolocation 
  database directory][GeoDB-Dir].
- [Human friendly error page][ErrorPage] should be saved as a static file.

Please refer to "[Validation timing][Validation]" for more details.

### What will become of my site if I use other plugin? ###

Well, it would not be so serious. Let's think about [WP Fastest Cache][WPFC] 
for example.

If someone requests a page where a cache hit occurs, no PHP code would be 
executed but static contents in the cache would be responded. In this case, 
this plugin has no chance to block anything.

If someone requests a page where a cache miss occurs, then WordPress would 
start to handle the request. In this case, this plugin would have a chance 
to validate the request.

So a visitor from forbidden countries sometimes gets cached contents and 
sometimes gets blocked. This means attack from forbedden countires would fail.
As a consequence, blocking by country can still reduce the risk of infection.
