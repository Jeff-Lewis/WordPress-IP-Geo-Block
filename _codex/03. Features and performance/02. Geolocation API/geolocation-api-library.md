---

[IP Geo Block][IP-Geo-Block] has multi source of geolocation database not only 
via internet but also on site DBs that are distributed from [Maxmind][Maxmind] 
and [IP2location][IP2location]. These on site DBs are managed by the dedicated 
class libraries named [IP Geo API][GitGeoAPI] which has been separately 
developed as an another project.

### Location of IP Geo API ###

IP Geo API can be installed one of the following folders:

1. `/wp-content/ip-geo-api/`
2. `/wp-content/uploads/ip-geo-api/`
3. `/wp-content/plugins/ip-geo-block/ip-geo-api/`

Its location depends on the permission of your WordPress tree. Actual location 
can be found at "**Local database settings**" section. If you find it to be the
3rd one, please consider to change to another location, because at every time 
this plugin updates, files in it will be removed.

![Local database settings]({{ '/img/2017-03/LocalDatabaseSettings.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Local database settings"
)

In some cases, you might see the following error message right after your first
installation. This would be caused by a permission touble due to your server's 
security configurations.

![Error of IP Geo API]({{ '/img/2016-09/ErrorGeoAPI.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Error of IP Geo API"
)

In this case, you have to install the library by your own hand. Please find how 
to do it in the codex "[How can I fix permission troubles?][Permission]".

### Type of database ###

This library provides the functionality of retrieving a country code from an 
IP address. You can get only a country code by default. But when you switch 
the type of database to another, you will be able to get the city name, 
coodinates of longitude and latitude.

Please refer to
[ip-geo-block-maxmind-zip-ipv4][MaxmindIPv4] and 
[ip-geo-block-maxmind-zip-ipv6][MaxmindIPv6] to know how to change the source 
of databases.

### CloudFlare & CloudFront API class library ###

If you are a user of [CloudFlare][CloudFlare] or [CloudFront][CloudFront] as a 
reverse proxy service, you might want to make use of the country code in their 
special offered environment variables.

Yes, you can do that if you install additional API library for those service.
Please refer to [CloudFlare & CloudFront API class library][APILibrary].
