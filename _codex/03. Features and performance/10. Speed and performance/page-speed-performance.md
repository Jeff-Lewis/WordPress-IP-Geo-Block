### Conditions ###

  Apache on a [shared hosting server](https://homepage.nifty.com/ "LaCoocan").  
  WordPress 4.6.1-ja / Theme: Twenty Twelve  
  PHP: PHP-5.2.14 (it's too old!!) / MySQL-5.5.21

  Here's the list of activated plugins.  
  
  ![Activated Plugins]({{ '/img/2016-11/P3-plugins.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
   "Activated Plugins"
  )

- **IP Geo Block:**  
  Version: 3.0.0 and later.  
  Settings:
  [ip-geo-block-settings.json](https://gist.github.com/tokkonopapa/a6805c53b32e0fb1dc49c19434e81591 "IP Geo Block settings for performance measure.")  

<div class="alert alert-info">
    The <strong>Validation timing</strong> shoule be set as 
    <strong>"init" action hook</strong>. If you set it as 
    <strong>"mu-plugins" (ip-geo-block-mu.php)</strong>, P3 would fail to 
    measure the performance of this plugin because 
    <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Must_Use_Plugins" title="Must Use Plugins &laquo; WordPress Codex">Must-use plugins</a>
    would be into the race condition.

### Results ###

[P3 (Plugin Performance Profiler)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/p3-profiler/ "P3 (Plugin Performance Profiler) &mdash; WordPress Plugins")
can investigate WordPress plugins' performance by measuring their impact on 
your site's load time.

This awesome tool has two mode to measure the performance. One is 
"**Auto scan**" which will access to both admin area and public facing pages 
under the confition of logged in as an admin. On the other hand, 
"**Manual scan**" mode can make it possible to freely access. So in this 
report, "**Manual scan**" had performed only by accessing front-end pages.

The following results were measured with a 
[private window](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/private-browsing-use-firefox-without-history "Private Browsing - Use Firefox without saving history | Firefox Help").

- **Use case 1:** - "**Auto scan**" (admin area + public facing pages)  
  ![The result of P3 (front-end and back-end)]({{ '/img/2016-11/P3-auto-scan.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
   "The result of P3 (front-end and back-end)"
  )
  
- **Use case 2:** - "**Manual scan**" (only public facing pages)  
  ![The result of P3 (only front-end)]({{ '/img/2016-11/P3-manual-scan.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
   "The result of P3 (only front-end)"
  )
