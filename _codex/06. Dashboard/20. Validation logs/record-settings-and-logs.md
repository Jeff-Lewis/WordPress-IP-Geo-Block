### HTTP Method ###

[RFC2616][RFC2616-SEC9] defines 8 method, i.e. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, 
OPTIONS, TRACE, CONNECT. The definitions says:

> In particular, the convention has been established that the GET and HEAD 
> methods SHOULD NOT have the significance of taking an action other than 
> retrieval. These methods ought to be considered "safe". This allows user 
> agents to represent other methods, such as POST, PUT and DELETE, in a 
> special way, so that the user is made aware of the fact that a possibly 
> unsafe action is being requested.

But in the real world, we can find a simple hyperlink (i.e. GET method) which 
takes an action other than retrieval.

![Media Library]({{ '/img/2016-01/MediaLibrary.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Media Library"
)

Anyway, we'd better take care about what's being done by a malicious request.

### $_POST keys ###

If a request submitted by POST method is blocked, keys in `$_POST` environment 
variable are recorded into the log. The corresponded keys in "**$_POST keys to 
be recorded with their values in logs**" are deployed to their values in order 
to take a look at them.

![Record settings]({{ '/img/2016-01/RecordSettings.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Record settings"
)

The recommended keys are as follows:

- `action`  
  This key is very popular in WordPress. It usually shows the process of doing 
  something.

- `comment`  
  It shows the contents of comment posted to `wp-comments-post.php`.

- `log`, `pwd`  
  The login name and password posted to `wp-login.php`. The `pwd` will be 
  masked with `***` when it comes from a logged in user.  
  ![Log of Login form]({{ '/img/2016-01/LogLoginForm.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
   "Log of Login form"
  )

- `FILES`  
  It shows the contents of HTTP File Upload variables `$_FILES` if 
  [POST method uploads][PHP-UPLOADS] was requested. (since 3.0.3)  
  ![Malicious file upload]({{ '/img/2017-04/LogUploadFile.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
   "Malicious file upload"
  )

### Description of "Result" ###

The following picutre shows the reason of blocking at "**Result**" column on 
"**Logs**" tab.

![Validation Logs]({{ '/img/2015-11/validation-logs.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Validation Logs"
)
