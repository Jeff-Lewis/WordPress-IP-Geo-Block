This is a maintenance release including 3 of bug fixes and 3 of improvements.
Every user of this plugin should update to make it work properly.

<!--more-->

### Fix the issue of login-fail-counter ###

In the last release 2.1.1, I added `block by country (register, lost password)`
which enables to login from anywhere but disables other actions such as new 
user registration or lost password. But "login-fail-counter" didn't work 
correctly only in this setting.

And now, it works properly to block brute force attack to the `wp-login.php`.

### Fix the issue of validation settings for admin ###

The `Admin area` and `Admin ajax/post` at "**Validation settings**" on 
"**Settings**" tab should be able to perform individual behavior. But 
previously it wasn't.

For example, `Prevent zero-day exploit` for `Admin area` protects a site 
against attacks even from your own country, and `Block by country` for 
`Admin ajax/post` protects against attacks from outside your country but 
always accepts ajax requested from your country.

![Validation settings]({{ '/img/2015-07/settings-admin.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Validation settings"
)

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  <strong>For technical details:</strong>
  <code>Prevent zero-day exploit</code> for <code>Admin ajax/post</code> can 
  also accept ajax requested from outside your own country if a plugin defines 
  same handler for privileged users and non privileged users. So its behavior 
  depeneds on the plugin's implementation.
</div>

### Fix some issues for Jetpack ###

Jetpack is a super popular plugin and has a lot of awesome features. But some 
of them were blocked by WP-ZEP. For example, "[Site Stats][SiteStats]" using 
**Sparkline** did not appear on the admin bar which issue was reported on the 
[support forum][issue-jet] (thanks [H][TH-WP-ORG]).

The solution is not perfect, but tentatively fixed. In the future release, 
compatibility with Jetpack should be more advanced.

### Improvement of diagnosis on admin screen ###

From [release 2.0.8][2.0.8], the diagnosis for validation logs had been 
implemented because of [issue #1][issue1]. In this release, the diagnosis is 
hidden behind the definition of symbol `IP_GEO_BLOCK_DEBUG`. To revive this 
functionality, add the following code in your `functions.php`.

{% highlight php %}
<?php define( 'IP_GEO_BLOCK_DEBUG', true ); ?>
{% endhighlight %}

With the above definition, additional functions will appear on 
"**Plugin settings**" at "**Setting**" tab as follows:

![Plugin settings]({{ '/img/2015-07/plugin-settings.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Plugin settings"
)

### Improvement of handling IPv6 in IP2Location ###

The [IP2Location&trade; PHP Module][IP2-PHP] can handle both IPv4 and IPv6 
using local database. But for the IPv6 it needs [GMP Functions][GMP] in the 
server. So I provide the alternatives using [BC Math Functions][BC-Math] in 
case there is no GMP in the server.

An advantage of using local database is getting detail information. You can 
download the [Free IP2Location LITE Databases][IP2-LITE] after you register 
your email address and sign up a free account.

Here's a sample and a result using the [DB5.LITE][DB5-LITE] which is uploaded 
into this plugin's database directory.

{% highlight php %}
<?php
/**
 * Set the path to the IP2Location Lite Database.
 *
 */
function my_ip2location_path( $path ) {
    return WP_PLUGIN_DIR . '/ip-geo-block/database/IP2LOCATION-LITE-DB5.IPV6.BIN';
}
add_filter( 'ip-geo-block-ip2location-path', 'my_ip2location_path' );

/**
 * Get the geolocation information of specific IP address.
 *
 */
function my_geolocation() {
    // IP_Geo_Block::get_geolocation(
    //    $ip = NULL, $providers = array(), $callback = 'get_country'
    // );
    //
    // @param string $ip IP address / default: $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']
    // @param array  $providers list of providers / ex: array( 'ipinfo.io' )
    // @param string $callback geolocation function / ex: 'get_location'
    // @return array country code and so on
    $geolocation = IP_Geo_Block::get_geolocation(
        '5.165.178.77', array( 'ip2location' ), 'get_location'
    );

    // [provider] => ip2location
    // [countryCode] => RU
    // [countryName] => Russian Federation
    // [regionName] => Penza
    // [cityName] => Penza
    // [latitude] => 53.2006607056
    // [longitude] => 45.0046386719
    var_dump( $geolocation );

    if ( isset( $geolocation['errorMessage'] ) ) {
        // error handling
    }
}
?>
{% endhighlight %}

### Improvement at activation process ###

At the activation process just after you had installed, this plugin uses 
RESTful API to get and put your country code into the whitelist. After that, 
[MaxMind GeoLite Legacy Database][GeoLite] was downloaded and used for the 
main source of validating the country code of IP addresses.

It meant that the database was different between before and after activation.
This had a possibility to block yourself by means of accuracy of those DBs.

<!-- https://wordpress.org/support/topic/doesnt-work-249 -->

From this release, MaxMind database will be also used at the activation to 
keep consistency of validation. (Of course, a fallback process in case that 
the service of MaxMind is unavailable is still there.)

Unfortunately when you are locked out yourself, download the 
[emergent version][Special] of `ip-geo-block.php` and upload it instead of the 
original one via FTP so that you can update your settings and this plugin itself.
