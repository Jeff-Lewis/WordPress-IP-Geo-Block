I expect this would be the final version which would be released before 
[3.0.0][CallFor300]. To put it in other words, this version includes some 
crucial features towards 3.0.0 for both protection ability and performance 
of speed. So I strongly hope every user update to this version!

### New feature: Validation timing ###

You can select timing about when to start the validation process of this plugin 
as one of these:

1. **"init" action hook**  
   Validate at init action hook same as typical plugins.

2. **"mu-plugins" (ip-geo-block-mu.php)**  
   Validate at an earlier stage than other plugins to reduce load of server.

![Validation timing]({{ '/img/2016-08/ValidationTiming.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Validation timing")

You can refer to those timing at [Plugin API/Action Reference][ActionHook].

Indeed, `ip-geo-block-mu.php` will be installed into `wp-content/mu-plugins/` 
directory when you select 2. It means that this plugin will run prior to other
regular plugins and reduce the load of server when blocking succeeds.

Note that in case of multisite, `ip-geo-block-mu.php` will be called on every 
site but won't affect a site where IP Geo Block is not activated.

#### Benchmark ####

I run a benchmark test on my local PC using [attack.sh][attack-sh] which is a 
wrapper of [ApacheBench][ApacheBench] but specialized for IP Geo Block under 
the following environment:

| Category      | Description                                                  |
|:--------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hardware      | MacBook Pro / 2.8GHz Core i7 / Memory 16GB                   |
| Software      | OS X 10.9.5 / MAMP Pro 3.5.2 (Apache 2.2.29, PHP 5.6.10)     |
| WordPress     | 4.6.1-ja / Site Language: English                            |
| Theme         | Child theme of Twenty Twelve (2.0)                           |

All the installed and activated plugins are:

![Installed Plugins]({{ '/img/2016-10/InstalledPlugins.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Installed Plugins")

And the options of IP Geo Block 2.2.9 are configured by "**Best practice**".

![Plugin settings]({{ '/img/2016-10/PluginSettings.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Plugin settings")

Here is the result (**OFF** indicates "deactivate"):

<div class="table-responsive">
	<table class="table">

				<th rowspan="2">Target</th>
				<th colspan="3">Requests/sec</th>

The performance had been improved about **47.42%** on average.

### Improvement: "Bad signature" for XSS ###

In my blog post [Analysis of Attack Vector against WP Plugins][AttackVector],
I mentioned that the basic strategy of this plugin against attacks is based on 
the following form:

{% highlight text %}
Attack Vector = Type x Path
{% endhighlight %}

While primarily this plugin focuses on inspection of `Path` which is composed 
of country blocking and [Zero-day Exploit Prevention for WP][WP-ZEP], 
inspection of `Type` had been also built in as "**Bad signatures in query**" 
since [2.2.5][CallFor225]. And from this release, some of simple signatures 
has been added internally to detect XSS.

Well, there're [a lot of patterns][OWASP-XSS] which cause XSS. But it's hard 
to filter out all the patterns from the requested query correctly using general 
rules because they strongly depend on the context which comes into view. For 
example, [Wordfence][Wordfence] [WAF][WF-WAF] blocks `<script>` when you put it 
into the search box. So you can't search this kind of words.

![Search forbidden]({{ '/img/2016-10/SearchScript.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Search forbidden")

In case of this plugin, the rule set for XSS is far simple than Wordfence.
But you can search `<script>` while `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` would be 
blocked.

The Wordfence users doesn't need this feature but I know this is crucial for 
considerable users who doesn't use WF because of its [page speed][PageSpeed].
