On December in 2017, the number of users of [IP Geo Block][IP-Geo-Block] have 
grown over 30,000. While being proud of this fact, I feel that this plugin 
should be improved much more because it is not ready to out-of-the-box.
The fact that the questions on the [forum][IPGB-Forum] related to the blocking 
behavior of this plugin have been increasing is telling about that.

I hope a new feature in this release can help to resolve the blocking issues 
when you have some experiences of unexpected blocking.

### New feature: "Find blocked requests" button ###

You can find a magnifying glass buttons <span class="emoji">
![Find blocked requests in “Logs”]({{ '/img/2018-01/find.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Find blocked requests in “Logs”")
</span> in "**Exceptions**" in "**Back-end target settings**" section.

![Find blocked request button]({{ '/img/2018-01/FindLogsButton.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Find blocked request button"
)

After clicking the button, you may find an icon 
<span class="emoji">
![Find and verify on “Logs” tab]({{ '/img/2018-01/alert.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Find and verify on “Logs” tab")
</span> attached to the item in the list of "**Candidate actions/pages**".
It indicates that there may be some blocked requests with its name of the 
action or page in the Logs. So when you click the icon <span class="emoji">
![Find and verify on “Logs” tab]({{ '/img/2018-01/alert.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Find and verify on “Logs” tab"), you can verify if it's malicious or not 
in a new opened window. If you confirm it's safe to accept, you can add it 
as "**Exceptions**".

The same feature is available in "**Plugins area**" and "**Themes area**" 
section.

Actually, this has almost the same meaning with error logs in 
"**Debug information**" which was equiped in [version 3.0.1][ReleaseVer301].
But I believe that it's huge better than before <span class="emoji">

</span>.

### Improvement: Support Nginx ###

If your server software is neither Apache nor LiteSpeed, and [`.user.ini`]
[USER_INI] is avaialble, you can now make "**Force to load WP core**" enabled 
at "**Plugins area**" and "**Themes area**" in "**Back-end target settings**" 
section.

![Support of Nginx]({{ '/img/2018-01/NginxUserInit.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Support of Nginx"
)

This feature enables to [prevent exposure of wp-config.php][WP-CONFIG] or 
other vulnerabilities against attacks to some [OMG <span class="emoji">
![emoji](https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f631.png)
</span>plugins and themes][OMG] even on Nginx.

One thing I should mention here is that this feature is full compatible with 
other plugins using `.user.ini` like [Wordfence Security][WORDFENCE]. Its WAF 
always works before WordPress core is loaded.

And also note that the following directive can be found in your configuration 
to deny access to the hidden files starting with a dot.

{% highlight nginx %}
location ~ /\. {
    deny all;
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Improvement: Toogle sorting order ###

Now "**Slug in back-end**" would pick up many requests. So "**Toogle sorting 
order**" button is now available.

![Slug in back-end]({{ '/img/2018-01/SlugBackend.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Slug in back-end"
)

### Improvement: UAlist in Logs ###

Sometimes you might be frustrated with not being able to find the reason why 
some certain requests were blocked or passed especially on the public facing 
pages.

I think that the reason mainly lies in the "[**UA string and qualification**]
[UA]" because in the previous version, it said just "**blocked**" at 
"**Result**" column in the Logs.

But now, you can find "**UAlist**" like this:

![UAlist in Logs]({{ '/img/2018-01/ValidationLogsUAlist.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "UAlist in Logs"
)

When you find it, please have a look at the rules in "**UA string and 
qualification**" in "**Front-end target settings**" section on "**Settings**" 
tab.

![UA string and qualification]({{ '/img/2018-01/UAstringsAmazon.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "UA string and qualification"
)

### Conclusion ###

From this version, I have more things to do than before for verifying the 
functionality not only on Apache but also on Nginx in addition to the browsers 
compatibility on different OS, single or multisite for sub-directory/sub-domain,
SSL, plugins and themes compatibility and so on. So I would be grateful for 
your continued cooperation to improve this plugins <span class="emoji">
