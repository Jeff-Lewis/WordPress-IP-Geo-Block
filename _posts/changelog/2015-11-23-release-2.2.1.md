[IP Geo Block 2.2.1][IP-Geo-Block] isn't so attractive for you because there's 
no new feature except several bug fixes, but it includes a very important 
alteration related to the IP address geolocation API for local databases of 
[Maxmind][Maxmind] and [IP2Location][IP2Location].

In this changelog, I'll mention about it.

<!--more-->

### Replacement of the directory for local databases ###

In the previous version, geolocation database files are located at as follows:

* Maxmind  
  `wp-content/plugins/ip-geo-block/database/`

* IP2Location  
  `wp-content/plugins/ip2location-{tags|variables|blocker}/`

With this configuration, the Maxmind DBs will always be removed and downloaded 
at every upgrading of this plugin.

Now, those DBs can be placed outside this plugin e.g. `wp-content/ip-geo-api/` 
to cut the above useless process. And also cooperation with IP2Location plugins
such as 
  [IP2Location Tags](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ip2location-tags/ "WordPress - IP2Location Tags - WordPress Plugins"),
  [IP2Location Variables](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ip2location-variables/ "WordPress - IP2Location Variables - WordPress Plugins"),
  [IP2Location Country Blocker](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ip2location-country-blocker/ "WordPress - IP2Location Country Blocker - WordPress Plugins")
had been deprecated.

Additionally, the class libraries for DBs can be put together under that 
directory. It means that the class libraries and DBs have become independent 
of this plugin. You can also get them from 
[WordPress-IP-Geo-API][IP-Geo-API] separately from this plug.

![WordPress-IP-Geo-API]({{ '/img/2015-11/IP-Geo-API.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "WordPress-IP-Geo-API"
)

#### Filter hook for DBs ####

The following filter hooks can be used to customize the settings of your DBs 
around.

* `ip-geo-block-api-dir`  
  Full path to the class libraries and local DB files.

* `ip-geo-block-maxmind-dir`  
  Full path where Maxmind GeoLite DB files should be saved.

* `ip-geo-block-ip2location-dir`  
  Full path where IP2Location LITE DB files should be saved.

* `ip-geo-block-ip2location-path`  
  Full path to IP2Location LITE DB file (IPv4).

And here is a sample code how to use these.

{% highlight php %}
<?php
function my_geodbs_dir( $dir ) {
    $upload = wp_upload_dir();
    return $upload['basedir'];
}
add_filter( 'ip-geo-block-maxmind-dir',     'my_geodbs_dir' );
add_filter( 'ip-geo-block-ip2location-dir', 'my_geodbs_dir' );
?>
{% endhighlight %}

</div>

You should always **deactivate then activate again** when you change your 
settings.

#### Option page ####

You can check your configuration for DBs at this plugin's option page.

![Local database settings]({{ '/img/2015-11/local-db-settings.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Local database settings"
)

### Don't you need different types of DBs? ###

In my observation on coverage for IPv6, Maxmind is better than IP2Location.
In any case, the coverage of each DB might be limited by their own data sources.
So I think something fallback might be needed.

If you don't want one of these, please remove `ip-geo-api/maxmind` or 
`ip-geo-api/ip2location` and this plugin would not download its DB files any 
more.
