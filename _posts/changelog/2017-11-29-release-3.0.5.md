I have been frequently asked about a question in the [forum][Forum] something 
like:

> I still get traffic from blacklisted countries!

I believe that this kind of question may be solved if you configure the 
settings like [UA string and Qualification][UA-Qualify] properly. But I 
agree that it's a bit difficult to find the reason and the solution.

So I had decided to provide some useful features in this release.
<!--more-->

### New screen: Validation logs ###

You may notice a new screen of "**Validation logs**". Previously, it was 
divided into some tables for each target, but they were integrated and 
displayed in one table.

![New screen - Logs]({{ '/img/2017-11/NewScreen-Logs.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "New screen - Logs"
)

Currently, it keeps 500 entries as a whole to limit the size of table in 
MySQL database.

### New feature: Live update ###

You may also notice the checkbox "**Live update**" at the top of the section.
It enables you to audit all the requests which are validated by this plugin 
almost in real time. Please turn it on and push the "**Start**" button to 
activate capturing the requests.

![Live update]({{ '/img/2017-11/LiveUpdate.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Live update"
)

The "**Pause**" button can stop updating the screen while it keeps capturing 
new requests for 60 seconds. After 60 seconds has passed or just pushing 
"**Stop**" button, it stops capturing. If you leave it as activated and jump 
to another page, then capturing will stop automatically at server side.

Unlike the normal logging, "**Live update**" doesn't need to be __persistent__.
So I prefer to hold it in SQLite database rather than MySQL as an internal 
buffer for read (client) and write (server). SQLite makes its database on the 
file system, and you can change its path via filter hook
[`ip-geo-block-live-log`][Live-Log].

{% highlight ruby %}
function my_sqlite_dsn( $path ) {
    return '/tmp/' . basename( $path );
}
add_filter( 'ip-geo-block-live-log', 'my_sqlite_dsn' );
{% endhighlight %}

Please note that it takes a few tens of milliseconds for writing as overhead.
In the future, I'd implement it as "In-Memory" database that may significantly
reduce the overhead (it would be executed within a few milliseconds). It has 
been almost done but still has some issues on it <span class="emoji">

</span>.

### New screen: Statistics in cache ###

The screen of "Statistics in cache" has been also updated and each IP address 
in the table is manageable. For example, if someone fails to login multiple 
times, then you can remove the IP address from the cache so that he/she can 
try to login again.

![New screen - Statistics in cache]({{ '/img/2017-11/NewScreen-Cache.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "New screen - Statistics in cache"
)

### Improvement: Statistics and Logs settings ###

In the previous version, this section was named as "**Record settings**".
And now, you can select a new mode "**When blocked or passed from undesired 
country**" as a condition to record logs.

![Statistics and Logs settings]({{ '/img/2017-11/LogsSettings.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Statistics and Logs settings"
)

With this mode, you can audit not only the blocked requests but also the 
requests "__passed__" from undesired countries (i.e. blacklisted countries or 
countries not in the whitelist). So I hope you can check if the rules in 
[UA string and Qualification][UA-Qualify] at "**Front-end settings**" works as 
you intend.

### New feature: filter hooks for Google APIs ###

[People in China can't reach][Google-Dev] [API Client Libraries][Google-APIs]
like [Google Charts][Google-Charts], [Google Hosted Libraries][Google-Ajax] 
and [Google Maps API][Google-Maps]. Although they utilize those services via 
VPN, the speed might be slow.

So two new filter hooks are now available in your `functions.php` :

{% highlight ruby %}
function my_google_jsapi( $url ) {
    return 'https://www.google.cn/jsapi';
}
function my_google_maps( $url ) {
    return 'https://maps.google.cn/maps/api/js';
}
add_filter( 'google-jsapi', 'my_google_jsapi' );
add_filter( 'google-maps',  'my_google_maps'  );
{% endhighlight %}

See also filter hook "[google-jspai, google-maps][Google-Hooks]".

Enjoy blocking! <span class="emoji">
