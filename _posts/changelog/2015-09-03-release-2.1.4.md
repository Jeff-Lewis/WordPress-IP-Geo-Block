I had to fix the bug which broke functionality of certain plugins such as 
[Types][Types].

<!--more-->

### Fix the issue related to the action in form ###

[Types][Types] is a very popular plugin, whose number of active installs is 
over 200,000. It makes your job easier to handle the content types, custom 
fields and taxonomies.

[![Types]({{ '/img/2015-09/Types.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
  "Types"
)][Types]

But [IP Geo Block][IP-Geo-Block] had inappropriately handled the `action` 
attribute in form of Types. So [it seemed blocked when creating a custom field 
or something][forum1]. (Thanks to [opsec][opsec] !!)

This issue will also happen with other plugins whenever the `action` in those 
forms are empty.

As for the specification, the current [HTML5 draft][html5-draft] says that:

> The action and formaction content attributes, if specified, **must have a 
> value that is a valid non-empty URL** potentially surrounded by spaces.

But empty `action` is not a rare case in old-school. So it should be filled 
with the URL to the document plus nonce to block a malicious access to the 
admin area.

In this release, empty `action` in HTML elements have been correctly handled.

### The section order from a UI point of view ###

In the early stages of development, this plugin has a singular function that 
blocks only spams from outside my country, and my main interest is which API 
should be used to get the country code. It means "**Geolocation API settings**"
was my first priority from a developer's point of view. But this is not same 
with a user's interest. So the order of sections on "**Settings**" tab has been 
rearranged in this release.

![Optimized resouces]({{ '/img/2015-09/SettingsPage.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Optimized resouces"
)

Additionally in the previous version, each tab loads js and css files for 
[FooTable][FooTable]. But obviously it was bad for the site performance point 
of view. So I've optimized loading resources.

### Checking process for validation rule ###

Most of users do not prefer themselves to be blocked. From this release, such 
a unexpected blocking will be prevented by default. This feature is proposed 
at [support forum][forum2]. (Thanks to [internationils][internationils] !!)

![Mismatched rule]({{ '/img/2015-09/ValidationRule.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Mismatched rule"
)

I think it's also useful to test the functionality of this plugin if it works 
correctly or not.

If you'd like to kill yourself, you can enable "**Force to save**" switch at 
"Plugin settings" just above the submit button.

![Force to save]({{ '/img/2015-09/Force-to-save.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Force to save"
)

Notice that this feature is not so user friendly because the setting data you 
want to update will be gone. So please be careful. It's not a feature to use 
actively!!
