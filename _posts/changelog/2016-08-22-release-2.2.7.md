Although I anounced "[Call for testing 3.0.0 beta][CallFor300]" last month, 
still I can not see the light at the end of my work. So I decided to release 
version 2.2.7 that has improved a few issues.

### Google Maps APIs Updates ###

On June 22, 2016, [Google anounced][GM-UPDATES] their [standard plan updates]
[GM-Standard] which would be applied to all [Google Maps APIs][GM-APIS].
It means that after the date, we need to [get API key][Get-Api-Key] to embed 
Google Map apps into our domains. On the other hand, active domains created 
before June 22, 2016, can continue to access the APIs.

So [IP Geo Block][IP-Geo-Block] should support both cases. What a hassle!

If you see the following warning, then your domain falls within the updates.

![Oops! Something went wrong.]({{ '/img/2016-08/GoogleMapsError.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Oops! Something went wrong.")

But don't worry! This plugin will fetch the warning and immediately configure 
to apply a fallback method using an `iframe` to show map like bellow:

![Google Map]({{ '/img/2016-08/GoogleMapsAPI.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Google Map")

Of course, you can configure your own API key for [Google Maps JavaScript API]
[JavaScriptAPI]. You can find the text field for Google Maps API key at 
**Plugin settings**.

![Google Maps API key at Plugin settings]({{ '/img/2016-08/PluginSettings.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Google Maps API key at Plugin settings")

### Keyless REST API in the future ###

This time, I programed the old REST API of Google Map <span class="emoji">
![earth](https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f30e.png)
</span> into the `iframe`. But in the future, it will be shut down. Then I will
use [HERE Maps][HERE-JS-API] <span class="emoji">
![pushpin](https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4cc.png)
</span>.
