In this release, I should fix some blocking issues to make it compatible with 
verious plugins and themes.

### Admin lock out by brute-force attack with same IP ###

At [support forum][IssueLockOut] I got an issue which caused self blocking 
right after this plugin's upgrade from 2.2.9.1 to 3.0.0. It seemed to be 
caused by the reason "**Limited**" which means:

> The number of login attempts reached to the limit.

Theoretically, it could happen if the dynamically assigned IP address was 
shared between admin and attacker. But of course, it's almost unlikely to 
happen.

I examined http load testing on my local server in order to emulate brute-force
attacks using [Apache Bench command][ApacheBench] at about 700 requests per 
minute. I had done it dozens of times and I had only one unreasonable error 
which was:

{% highlight ruby %}
PHP Warning: call_user_func_array() expects parameter 1 to be a valid callback, class 'IP_Geo_Block_Logs' does not have a method 'exec_sql' in /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/wp-includes/class-wp-hook.php on line 298
{% endhighlight %}

I also tested the previous version 2.2.9.1 as same times and I got an error 
which was quite understandable:

{% highlight ruby %}
WordPress database error Deadlock found when trying to get lock; try restarting transaction for query DELETE FROM `wp_ip_geo_block_logs` WHERE `hook` = 'login' ORDER BY `No` ASC LIMIT 1 made by require('wp-load.php'), require_once('wp-config.php'), require_once('wp-settings.php'), include_once('/mu-plugins/ip-geo-block-mu.php'), IP_Geo_Block::get_instance, IP_Geo_Block->__construct, IP_Geo_Block_Loader->run, call_user_func, IP_Geo_Block->validate_login, IP_Geo_Block->validate_ip, IP_Geo_Block_Logs::record_logs, IP_Geo_Block_Logs::add_sql, QM_DB->query
{% endhighlight %}

The difference between those two versions related to this issue is the timing 
when to write the fetched IP address into the MySQL DB whose command would be 
issued just before sending a response code to the attacker in 2.2.9.1 while 
just at [shutdown action hook][ShutdownHook] in 3.0.0.

So I decided to revise the timing in 3.0.0 back to the same as 2.2.9.1. Sorry 
but I can not say this change would fix the issue for certain.

#### Prevent blocking ####

As a workaround, I implemented a blocking prevention against this issue. when 
the above happens, you can see the following warning on admin dashboard:

![Dashboard message]({{ '/img/2016-12/dashboard-message.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Dashboard message"
)

When you see this, please go to "**Statistics**" tab of IP Geo Block settings 
page and execute "**Clear cache**" to resolve blocking.

### Installation information ###

When you unfortunately encount a blocking issue while you're logged in, you'll 
see the following unless you setup a [human friendly error page][FriendlyPage]:

![Blocking message]({{ '/img/2016-12/forbidden-message.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Blocking message"
)

The "**Dashboard**" is a kind of safety zone for logged in user so that you'll 
never be blocked.

As you know, this plugin potencially have some blocking issues that should 
be improved. When you meet them, please find "**Installation information**" 
section at the bottom of the this plugin's option page and push "**Show 
information**" button!

![Installation information]({{ '/img/2016-12/install-info.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Installation information"
)

This button gathers some useful informations so that you can copy &amp; paste 
and easily submit your issue at [support forum][SupportForum]. Please feel 
free to use it. I always appreciate you to let me know these infomations.

Thanks for reading to the end. <span class="emoji">
