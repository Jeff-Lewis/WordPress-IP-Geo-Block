Since I already had mentioned about changes of 2.2.5 beta1 compared to 2.2.4.1 
in [the previous article][CallForTest], I don't have much about the release 
version except for the compatibility of downloading IP address database zip 
files for Microsoft IIS from [IP2Location][IP2Location].

<!--more-->

### Compatibility of unzip ###

In the previous version, I used native [ZipArchive][ZipArchive] to unzip the 
IP address databases downloaded from [IP2Location LITE &trade;][IP2LocLite].

But my user [Greg][Greg] reported [the issue which was caused on windows IIS]
[ISSUE-ON-WIN].

Thanks to the WP core contributors, I can use [`download_url()`][DownloadURL] 
and [`unzip_file()`][UnzipFile] that works fine on his Windows 2008 server as 
follows:

{% highlight ruby startinline %}
$zip = download_url( $url );
if ( !is_wp_error( $zip ) ) {
    WP_Filesystem();
    $result = unzip_file( $src, $dest_path );
    unlink( $zip );
}
{% endhighlight %}

According to [this document][WP-ON-IIS], WordPress needs IIS 8.5, but Greg's 
IIS is 7. So we're lucky to say it turned out Okay in the end!

### Bug fix: Restoring revisions ###

In WordPress, `wp-admin/revision.php` controls the revisions. But when you 
turn on "**Prevent Zero-day Exploit**", comparing revisions didn't work in the 
previous version 2.2.4.1 because of the lack of this plugin's special nonce.

![Rivisions]({{ '/img/2016-05/revision.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Rivisions"
)

The revision data would be embeded into the page like follows:

{% highlight json %}
{
    "author": {
        "avatar": "<img alt='' src='...' />",
        "id": 1,
        "name": "tokkonopapa"
    }, 
    "autosave": false,
    "current": false,
    "date": "May 29, 2016 @ 10:55",
    "dateShort": "29 May @ 10:55",
    "id": 34,
    "restoreUrl": "http://localhost/wp-admin/revision.php?revision=34&action=restore&_wpnonce=...",
    "timeAgo": "7 hours ago",
    "title": "Hello world!"
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now a special nonce is added to "`restoreUrl`" and comparing revisions works 
well.

### Updating DBs on cron job in mutisite ###

How do you manage your multisite? Do you activate the plugins by "Network 
activate"? or activate the plugins via [InfiniteWP client][InfiniteWP] for 
each blog?

In the previous version, there was an issue that updating of IP address DBs 
by wp-cron were not excuted on each blog but only main blog when you select 
"network activate" on multisite.

Actually, it will do no harm. But when you look at the "**Last update**" of 
DBs, you would have doubts that cron might not work collectly.

So in this release, "**Last update**" will be synchronized with each blog 
when you "network activate" this plugin for all blogs collectively.

### Final thought ###

Since I built up my application development environment on my local PC that 
I mentioned in [this article][Confession], I become to have a lot of things 
to test use cases especially about multisite and SSL configurations.

Basically, WordPress can handle both "Sub-directory" type and "Sub-domain" 
type for multisite. For example, we can find the URLs both 
[https://wordpress.org/plugins/][WP-PLUGINS] and 
[https://codex.wordpress.org/][WP-CODEX], and those are based on 
[https://wordpress.org/][WP-ORG]. I don't know these sites share the same 
WordPress core. But this flexibility as a CMS brings us huge advantage. 
Of couse, sometimes the flexibility leads to the complexity and it brings us 
developers the cause of the trouble <span class="emoji">
