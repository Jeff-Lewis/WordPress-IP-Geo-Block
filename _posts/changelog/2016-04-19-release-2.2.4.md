Because I'm not a native english speaker, it is difficult to express something 
in English. After [some discussions][DISCUSSION] (many thanks to [John][JOHN]), 
I realized again that simple and straightforward is always the best

### New feature: Auto configuration of .htaccess ###

Previously, you should configure your `.htaccess` in your `plugins` and 
`themes` directories to [prevent malicious accesses against the PHP files]
[PREVENT] in those directories. But now you can just turn on the checkboxes 
"**Force to load WP core**".

![Force to load WP core by .htaccess]({{ '/img/2016-04/force-loading-wp.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Force to load WP core by .htaccess"
)

Unfortunately, I'm not familiar with **nginx**. So currently this feature is 
available only for **apache** but both should be supported in the future.

### New feature: Export / Import settings ###

"**Export settings**" button exports setting parameters which are displayed on 
the your browser to the json file. And "**Import settings**" button imports 
from the json file.

![Export / Import settings]({{ '/img/2016-04/plugin-settings.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Export / Import settings"
)

The content in json file looks something like this:

{% highlight json starinline %}
{
    "ip_geo_block_settings[version]": "2.2.4",
    "ip_geo_block_settings[matching_rule]": "0",
    "ip_geo_block_settings[white_list]": "JP",
    "ip_geo_block_settings[black_list]": "ZZ",
    "ip_geo_block_settings[extra_ips][white_list]": "",
    "ip_geo_block_settings[extra_ips][black_list]": "",
    "ip_geo_block_settings[response_code]": "403",
    "ip_geo_block_settings[login_fails]": "5",
    ...
    "ip_geo_block_settings[clean_uninstall]": ""
}
{% endhighlight %}

These data will be validated on the server side to prevent XSS. I think this 
feature is useful for your multisite.

### Bug fix for multisite ###

Some links on the "**Networks admin dashboard**" would be blocked when you 
enabled "**Prevent zero-day exploit**" for "**Admin area**" or "**Admin 
ajax/post**".

Sorry but even with this fixation, [IP Geo Block][IP-Geo-Block] is not ready 
for multisite with full of its requirements. I hope I can release it in the 
next version <span class="emoji">

</span> .

### Better audit of locking self out ###

When you selected "Whitelist" as "**Matching rule**" but your country code was 
not in the "**Country code for matching rule**", the following admin notice 
appeared:

![Admin notice]({{ '/img/2016-04/admin-notice.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Admin notice"
)

It was too bad not only about its expression but also its functionality, 
because it persistently appeared even in case the your IP address was in the 
"**Whitelist of extra IP addresses prior to country code**".

Now no more admin notice appears when you assign "**Validation rule settings**"
like this:

![Validation rule settings]({{ '/img/2016-04/validation-rule-settings.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Validation rule settings"
)

#### Note: ####

For the performance point of view, I think the following `wp-admin/.htaccess` 
is much better than the above if you know the range of your IP addresses.

{% highlight Config File starinline %}
order deny,allow
allow from 203.216.247.0/24
deny from all
<FilesMatch "admin-(ajax|post).php$">
    Satisfy Any
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
    Deny from none
</FilesMatch>
{% endhighlight %}
