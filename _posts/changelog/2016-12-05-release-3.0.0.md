I'm very pleased to announce the release of new version which has a featured 
function "**blocking on front-end**" !

<!--more-->

### New feature: Blocking on front-end ###

#### TL;DR ####

I love [right to internet access][DigitalRights] and hate [internet 
censorship][Censorship]. That's why I've hesitated to equip [IP Geo Block]
[IP-Geo-Block] with this feature until now. The purpose of it is not for 
[regional restrictions on content][GeoBlocking] itself but definitely for 
security. However "**The end justifies the means**". As for 
  [my analysis of this plugin's security performance][AttackVecors], 
this version has now greatly improved its potential ability for defence.

  "Analysis of Attack Vectors")][AttackVecors]

#### Front-end target settings ####

OK, let's look at a new section named "**Front-end target settings**".

[![Front-end target settings]({{ '/img/2016-11/FrontEndSettings.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
  "Front-end target settings")][FrontEnd]

- **Matching rule**  
  You can specify it independently of one at "**Validation rule settings**".

- **Validation target**  
  You can select either "**All requests**" or "**Specify the targets**".
  In the latter case (which is a bonus feature <span class="emoji">
  ![gift](https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f381.png)
  </span>), you can specify the type of single and archive pages as blocking 
  target.

- **UA string and qualification**  
  You can flexibly make a special rule set for each user agent to control 
  their passage and blockade so as not to be afraid about [SEO][SEO-WIKI].

It's very simple and streight forward, isn't it? You can find some details
in "[Overview][Overview]" and also 
in "[UA string and Qualification][Qualification]".

#### Chrome Compression Proxy ####

Google provides their [data saver][Data-Saver] which can significantly reduce 
cellular data usage to optimize website content for Android.

[![Chrome Compression Proxy]({{ '/img/2016-11/compression-proxy.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
  "Chrome Compression Proxy")][Data-Saver]

This service keep client's IP address in `X-Forwarded` header. So this plugin 
will automatically replace it as the origin IP address.

### Living with caching plugin ###

Currently, this plugin supports 
  [WP Super Cache][WP-Super-Cache],
  [W3 Total Cache][W3-Total-Cache] and
  [Vendi Cache][Vendi-Cache] (which was formerly built in
  [Wordfence][Wordfence])
under certain conditions. For example, **WP Super Cache** must be configured 
to **use PHP** with "**Late init**".

![WP Super Cache]({{ '/img/2016-08/WP-Super-Cache.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "WP Super Cache")

For more detail, please refer to the documents "[Living with caching plugin]
[CachingPlugin]".

### Security and Speed ###

Definitely we need both of them. So you might be intersted in not only the 
[performance on back-end][Release229] but also 
[performance on front-end][SpeedPerform].

It's hard to strike a balance between them because a caching plugin would try 
to respond the contents without excuting any PHP codes at the very beggining 
of WordPress core proccess. That's why [Wordfence][Wordfence] once had their 
own caching system named [Falcon Engine][FalconEngine].

I'm not satisfied with caching by PHP and late initialization. So I'd like to 
challenge to make this plugin more compatible with other caching plugins in 
the future!
