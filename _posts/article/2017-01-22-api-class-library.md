[IP Geo Block][IP-Geo-Block] has been developed separately from 
[IP Geo API][IP-Geo-API], a geolocation API class library which 
supports local database provided by only [Maxmind][Maxmind] and 
[IP2Location][IP2Location].

But when you use [CloudFlare][CloudFlare] or [CloudFront][CloudFront] as a 
reverse proxy service, you can retrieve a visitor's IP address and country 
code from their special offered environment variables.

In this article, I'll show you how to make use of their services.

<!--more-->

### CloudFlare ###

CloudFlare provides the verious client information via 
[HTTP request headers][CF-Headers]. For example, an IP address can be 
retrieved from `CF-Connecting-IP` and the country code from `CF-IPCountry`.

So here is a sample of API class library for CloudFlare.

<!--<div id="gist-cloudflare"></div>-->
<script src="https://gist.github.com/tokkonopapa/d467976c4628e0be1fda6f57cf721c21.js"></script>

The key point here is that the above library should be named as 
`class-zcloudflare.php` and typically placed under the directory 
named `/wp-content/ip-geo-api/zcloudflare/`.

You might wonder why `z` + `cloudflare`?

Well, it's just a matter of convenience for this plugin to give it 
a highest priority!

### CloudFront ###

CloudFront also provides the client information via [HTTP response headers]
[AM-Headers]. So the code is almost same as CloudFlare. You can find it at 
[tokkonopapa/class-zcloudfront.php][AM-ClassLib].

### Pros and Cons ###

The advantage of using these libraries is definitely the response time that 
is important especially for front-end. It's almost zero.

)

On the other hand, the disadvantage is any IP address can not be retrieved 
on "**Search**" tab. In this case, you should just select other API

 "Search tab"
