[Jetpack][Jetpack.me] is the Swiss army knife for your WordPress site.
A plentiful awesome features are served for free by hooking to the 
WordPress.com.

In this article, I show some notes related to living with 
[Jetpack][Jetpack.wp] and [IP Geo Block][IP-Geo-Block].

<!--more-->

### Connecting to WordPress.com ###

When IP Geo Block inhibits accessing to the `xmlrpc.php` by country code, 
connecting to WordPress.com will fail at the activation process.

![Connect to WordPress.com]({{ '/img/2015-08/Jetpack-connect.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Connect to WordPress.com"
)

And also accessing to the `Admin area` should not be `Prevent Zero-day exploit` 
to lead the activation process to success.

![Validation Settings]({{ '/img/2015-08/ValidationSettings.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Validation Settings"
)

Once the self-hosted Jetpack successfully connects to your WordPress.com account,
those settings can be configured as you like.

### Login protection ###

Jetpack has a cloud-based brute force protection module called "[**Jetpack 
Protect**][JPP]" which collects malicios IPs from Jetpack users in the world.
But if another plugin that has same functionality ([Limit Login Attempts][LLA], 
[Wordfence Security][WFS], [BulletProof Security][BPS] and so on) is already in 
your site, Jetpack Protect will not be activated to avoid conflict.

IP Geo Block has also a same functionality but it blocks accesses to the 
`wp-login.php` itself. It means that IP Geo Block works at more early stage 
than Jetpack.

And if a malicios login attempt comes from your own country, Jetpack Protect 
serves its function so well.

So the conflict never happnes <span class="emoji">
